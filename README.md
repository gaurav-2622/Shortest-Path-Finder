# Shortest Path Finder

## Overview
This project implements a Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing efficient route calculations in a weighted graph.

## Features
- Add edges to the graph with weights.
- Calculate the shortest path between nodes.
- Use of priority queues for performance optimization.

## Requirements
- Java 11 or higher

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files:

## Future Enhancements
- I will add UI elements to make the application more representational and user-friendly.
